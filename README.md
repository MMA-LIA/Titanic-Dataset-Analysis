1  I have answered the following questions in this tutorial.
2  Read and check your dataset
3  [Bar plot] Distribution of Pclass in percentage
4  [Bar plot] Which Pclass had a better chance of survival?
5  [Bar plot] Which age_group had a better chance of survival considering the gender?
6  [Pie plot] Distribution of Pclass in percentage.
7  [Histogram] Distribution of Siblings/Spouses Aboard and Parents/Children Aboard.
8  [Boxplot] Which ss_group ('0', '1-2', '3-6', and '7-8') has survived more?
9  [Scatterplot] For the passengers younger than 20, is there a difference, by gender, between survivors who had no sibling/spouse vs. who had one sibling/spouse? What about vs. more than one sibling/spouse?
10  [Scatterplot] A plot with age, fare, ss_group, and survivors/non-survivors.
11  [Heatmap] Find the "age_group - Siblings/Spouses Aboard" and "age_group -Parents/Children Aboard" pairs with survivor rate over 60%.
12  [3D interaction] For the passengers younger than 20, is there a difference, by gender, between survivors who had no parents/children aboard vs. who had one parent/child aboard? What about vs. more than one parent/child aboard?
